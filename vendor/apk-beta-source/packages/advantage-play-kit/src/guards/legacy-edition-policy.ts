/**
 * Legacy edition policy that retires the 75-file dual-pack ABI behind the
 * canonical standard-pack resolver.
 *
 * The `editions` module is the surviving legacy dual-pack ABI: it carries
 * edition/theme asset bindings, the `AssetPackManifest` / `SemanticAssetBinding`
 * physical-pack contract, and the 75-file required-pack inventory. T11 does not
 * preserve it as a production compatibility surface for new cartridges. New
 * shared-kit modules (systems, scaffolding, guards, compatibility, testing
 * extensions) must remain edition-free and route through the accepted
 * `createAcceptedStandardAssetResolver` instead.
 *
 * The editions module remains importable only by the existing runtime host
 * adapter and its tests while the runtime contract migrates to the canonical
 * resolver; this is recorded as tech debt, not a production surface.
